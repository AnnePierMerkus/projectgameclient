On the blackboard course, the assignment contains the following:

> In this project we will develop a client / server application that can be used to create various games
played. This may involve human versus computer (AI) and computer versus computer. The emphasis in this
project is computer versus computer, the application with the smartest AI should win.

Our goal will be to recieve an __8__ or higher, preferably a 10 of course, and make it to at least the semi finals in the tournament scheduled on the __15th of April__.
